# Number-Plate-recognation
With the increasing threats to human life its important not to allow any unknown into our apartments so, i have used CCTV photages and processed it to find whether that specific
car belongs to our apartment or not.
Did this processing for both stationary car's and also for moving car's.
I have created a database using MySQl which cntains the list of all the cars which should be given access into the apartments.
Firstly, the number is retrieved from the number plate of cars and then compared with the database which contains the whole list of car numbers if the number is matched with any 
number in the database then access will be granted and the door will be opened automatically with the help of door sensor.
